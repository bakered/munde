# Which Honeymoon? You Choose!

Your presence at our wedding is gift enough, and unfortunately we won't be able to take any large presents home with us due to transport and customs problems. 
  
But if you did want to give a gift then you could either send one to: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed & Mirja Baker,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c/o Stehnken,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finowstraße 26,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12045 Berlin,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany  

...or you could donate to one of the following honeymoon pots, and we will go on the honeymoon with the fullest pot.  
(but don't worry, we still get the money from the losing pots)
